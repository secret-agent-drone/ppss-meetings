\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\itemi Attendance}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\itemii Opening}
	\item {\itemii Attendance to be taken}
	\item {\itemii Apologies}
	\item {\itemii Committee Membership}
	\end{enumerate}
\item {\itemi Advertising for Physical Systems}

Melbourne will have Physical Systems

Wave optics

Classical mechanics

Solving differential systems as physical systems

(A little bit of) Overlap with some math subjects (DEs, Mathematica Mehods od Physics) (but not so much that there' anti-requisites)

2nd year subject; 3rd years can take it (good for them, they have context)

Put up posters?

Advertising cannot be on LMS

We should get it on the PSS

Braden will correspond with PSS re: everything

Innes says: ``They're like five''
\item {\itemi Mentoring}
\item {\itemi Funds and Assets}

Most cost = post-Completion talk food, Easter, Pool, Trivia

Do we need a TV? Probably not

Level 7: platters, IKEA stuff, cutting board, knife, cheese knife

GOSS funds for knives and forks

Assets: board games, PPSS banner, pull-down screen (School of Physics could do)


\item {\itemi Semester event plan}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Other events
		
	Snooker - semester opposite the pool competition?
	
	One more ``bigger'' event this semester?
	
	Talent show? Logisitically difficult
	
	Karaoke night?
	
	New events poll?	
	
	Australia's Biggest Morning Tea?
	
	PPSS think the mentoring (graduates come in to tutes and talk for 10 minutes) thing is bad
	
	
	\item Pool Competition
	
	Running the week of Monday 4th April
	
	Final on Friday 8th April
	
	Signups close Monday 4th April
	
	Posters
	
	Prizes: alcohol (two different bottles), name engraved of trophy
		
	
	\item Diversity Fair/Event
	
	Daniel says:
	
	Lots of people don't know other groups exists
	
	Not nearly enough collaboration between STEM groups (Chemistry, Physics, optical students association, WISE, Geology(??), Biology(??), WIP)
	
	We'll have a lot of money by pooling resources
	
		
	
	\end{enumerate}
\item {\itemi Reports}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Academic Staff Committee

	Cate got kicked out because the topic of discussion was EPP leadership position	
	
	\item Academic Progress Committee
	
	Innes went to a meeting
	
	Physics Advanced had a lot of people enrolled
	
	By LMS is shit; some people are taking it that haven't done physics
	
	2nd year Comp labs - lots of people enrolled this semester, as well as last semester (We hope Engineers will join)
	
	Comp is going well	
	
	Legacy subjects are difficult to deal with
	
	Sean and Harry have done good work with LMS
	
	Calc2, Lin Alg - no longer prerequisites
	
	Problem with UMEP students, something about amount of points
	
	Change to Physics major
	
	Senior demonstrators/tutor (teaching fellows) - should be doing more things	
	
	Bureaucratic bullshit re: Grad centre computers
	
	\item Knowledge Engagement

	Work experience - 24 students for the faculty (out of 100s applied)
	
	Could be asking students to help out with this (guiding them around, etc.)
	
	WIP: 29th April - 1st May	
	
	July lectures: 100 Years of GR, grav waves
	
	Nothing yet for Open Day
	
	Colloquiums booked up until May	
	
	\item Research and Research Training

	No-one was there	
	
	\item Occupational Health and Safety
